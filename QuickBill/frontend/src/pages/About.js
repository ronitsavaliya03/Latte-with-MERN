Our application is a simple, yet efficient, platform that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing a hands-on example of how modern web apps manage data and user interactions. Through this project, we aim to offer a clear, functional reference for building dynamic and responsive applications.</p><br/>
