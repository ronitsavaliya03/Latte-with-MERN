# Project Summary

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The application allows users to manage data by performing fundamental operations like adding new records, viewing details, editing existing entries, and deleting records. It features a responsive user interface developed with React, connected to a backend server powered by Node.js and Express, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing and retrieving data. This project demonstrates the essential workings of full-stack development and serves as a foundation for more complex web applications.
